# Creating data-linked interactive heatmaps using ggiraph and knitr

This is a quick blog highlighting the possibility of using `ggiraph` to create a heatmap in which rows/columns/cells can be a) moused-over to be identified and b) clicked to navigate to a source of additional data on the observations.  I find doing this very useful for exploratory data analysis.  A link to the knitted .html file will be posted here shortly.
